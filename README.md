💡 **TL;DR**: Rugpi enables you to **build commercial-grade, customized variants of [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)** for your project.
It boasts three core features: (1) A modern workflow to build customized system images, (2) robust **over-the-air updates with rollback support** of the entire system, including firmware files, and (3) **managed state** which is preserved across reboots and updates.

Checkout the [documentation](https://oss.silitics.com/rugpi/) for details.

### Supported Boards

In principle, Rugpi supports all Raspberry Pi models.
For further details, [read the docs](https://oss.silitics.com/rugpi/docs/guide/supported-boards).

If you like the workflow and want to use Rugpi for other boards than Raspberry Pi, please contact us.

### Stability Guarantees

While Rugpi is a young and evolving project, we understand that the lifetime of embedded devices spans multiple years, if not decades. We aim to maintain backwards-compatibility for updates. This ensures that devices using Rugpi can be updated in the future. If you're developing integrations with Rugpi, please be aware that the building pipeline, CLI, and APIs are expected to change.
